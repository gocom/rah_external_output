h1. rah_external_output

p. Rah_external_output is a "Textpattern":http://textpattern.com plugin that outputs custom content-type snippets that can be requested via URL, but do not require "page templates":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Pages or "sections":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Sections.

p. This makes the plugin ideal for generating various publicly accessible snippets, like XML feeds or JavaScript Object Notations that can be then used to feed content to JavaScript scripts, or to integrate site content cross-domains.

p. The plugin uses Textpattern's "Form snippets":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Forms to power it's external output pages. You create a normal misc form with a prefixed name, and that form is then can be requested and access via direct URL by referring its name.

p. The term _external_ directly refers to separateness and freeing dependency from sections and page templates while still serving client-side content. Only thing you need to serve content is a form. In essence the plugin is for accessing a form's output via a callback URL.

h2. List of features

* "Form partials":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Forms that names are prefixed with @rah_eo_@ can be requested, and their output accessed, directly using a public URL.
* In addition to normal form partials, these special forms can contain HTTP header lines. Lines at the beginning of the form staring with a semicolon are treated as headers.
* Form partials can be served using different content-type by appending file extension to the name.

h2. Requirements

p. Rah_external_output's minimum requirements:

* Textpattern v4.4.1 or newer.
* PHP5 or newer.

h2. Installing

p. The general behavior stands when it comes to installing rah_external_ouput. No extra steps or configuration that variates from normal is needed.

# Download plugin installation file and copy its contents to clipboard.
# Navigate to "Plugins":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Plugins panel and paste the copied code into the _Install plugin_ field, and click *Upload*.
# You will be shown a preview of the plugin and its documentation. Click *Install* at the bottom of the page.
# You will be returned to the plugin list when the plugin has been installed. Now activate the plugin by clicking its *No* link, which toggles the status to *Yes* and actives it.
# The plugin is now installed and activated. All done.

h2. Usage

p. Rah_external_output treats misc type forms partials that are prefixed with @rah_eo_@ as a "external" content-type snippets. These special prefixed Forms can be accessed using a URL. This URL would follow a pattern:

bc. http://example.com/?rah_external_output=FormNameWithoutPrefix

p. Where @example.com@ is the site's URL and @FormNameWithoutPrefix@ is the form's name excluding the prefix. The above URL would output a misc Form named @rah_eo_FormNameWithoutPrefix@.

h2. Custom HTTP headers

p. In addition to a form template's normal features, rah_external_output's special forms support sending custom HTTP headers, including a content-type header.

p. All lines at the beginning of the form starting with a semicolon (@;@) are sent as HTTP headers. These lines should be placed at the very beginning of a form, starting from the first line. HTTP header lines and can not be preceded by any white-space or empty lines.

p. HTTP header lines follow the normal syntax you would expect from a HTTP header field definitions. A line consist of header property, also commonly referred as the field, followed by a colon (@:@) and a value.

bc. ; Property: Value

p. A form supports unlimited number of header lines. Each subsequent line starting with a semicolon is sent as a HTTP header.

bc. ; Content-type: text/javascript
; Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, pre-check=0, post-check=0, max-age=0
; Expires: Sat, 24 Jul 2003 05:00:00 GMT
; Last-Modified: Wed, 1 Jan 2025 05:00:00 GMT
; Pragma: no-cache

p. Using these HTTP header lines visitor can be redirected, or document's content-type, encoding, caching or timestamp attributes changed. A form that starts with a following header line would be sent as a plain-text.

bc.. ; Content-type: text/plain

<txp:article_custom limit="15">
	<txp:permlink><txp:title /></txp:permlink>
</txp:article_custom>

p. Note that for security reasons HTTP header lines can not contain Textpattern tags. Headers are collected from the source code before any Textpattern tags are processed. This to prevent any type of header injections that could occur otherwise.

h2. Content-types and extensions

p. In addition to custom HTTP headers, a snippet's content-type can be set using file extensions, appended to the form's name. Supported extensions are @.json@, @.js@, @.xml@, @.css@, @.txt@ and @.html@.

p. If a form is named as @rah_eo_jsontable.json@, the content would be served as a JSON presentation when @http://example.com/?rah_external_output=jsontable.json@ is being accessed.

h2. Tag trace and debugging

p. As Textpattern's normal page templates, rah_external_output's snippets support "tag traces.":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=tag_trace In "debugging mode,":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Basic_Preferences#Production_Status a tag trace is appended to the HTML output of each snippet that ends with @.html@ extension. As a tag trace on a normal page, the trace tells you which Textpattern tags are being executed and their outcome.

h2. Example uses and snippets

p. As the plugin can be used to serve any type of document and content there is no to say what you should do with it or not. To give out a simple idea how you could benefit from the plugin, please see our "examples directory on GitHub":https://github.com/gocom/rah_external_output/tree/master/examples. The directory contains some basic, yet real-world proof, examples. XML sitemap generation contains all your content and some JSON are covered say the least.

h2. For developers

p. The plugin comes with couple things targeted to developers. One of these is dedicated callback event which is fired each time a snippet is viewed. The callback in question is named @rah_external_output.snippet_end@ and is executed at the very end of a snippet.

p. There is also a global variable that can be used to add extra recognized mime-types to the plugin. The variable is named @$rah_external_output_mime@ and takes an array map of @extension => mime/type@ key-value pairs.
