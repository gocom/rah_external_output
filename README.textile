h1. rah_external_output

p. Output external content-type snippets. The plugin, rah_external_output, is used to output external scripts with custom content types. By external we mean that you don't have to waste sections, forms nor page templates for the scripts, and scripts (aka _global output forms_) can be easily used for other applications, for example ajax calls or a custom XML page.

h3(#changelog). Changelog

p. *Version 0.9*

* Fixed: now handles raw PHP tags.
* Changed: now parses tag structure in same fashion as core. Do it twice. Provides identical results with core in every scenario.
* Added: ability to display tag trace, and error reporting, by adding @rah_external_output_trace@ parameter (@&rah_external_output_trace=1@) to the snippet URL when site's production status is set to _debugging_.

p. *Version 0.8*

* Added: CSRF (session riding) protection using Textpattern's core functions introduced in v4.4.1.
* Changed: Make sure the plugin interfaces is all in one language.
* Changed: Only try to drop old database tables when humanly possible that there is old leftovers. Don't run queries when updating from clean to clean.
