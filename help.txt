h1. rah_external_output

p. Output external content-type snippets. The plugin, rah_external_output, is used to output external scripts with custom content types. By external we mean that you don't have to waste sections, forms nor page templates for the scripts, and scripts (aka _global output forms_) can be easily used for other applications, for example Ajax calls or a custom XML page.
