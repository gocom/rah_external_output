h1. rah_external_output

p. Output external content-type snippets. The plugin, rah_external_output, is used to output external scripts with custom content types. By external we mean that you don't have to waste sections, forms nor page templates for the scripts, and scripts (aka _global output forms_) can be easily used for other applications, for example Ajax calls or a custom XML page.

h3(#list-of-features). List of features

* Clean interface to write and adjust code snippets.
* Create and set content-types for the code snippets.
* Two ways to display the scripts: An automatic URL call, and an alternative tag function to display the end results.

h3(#requirements). Requirements

p. Rah_external_output's minimum requirements:

* PHP 4.3.0
* Textpattern 4.0.7 or newer. TXP v4.2.0 is required for full feature support, 4.0.7 doesn't support some minor things.

p. Recommended:

* Textpattern 4.4.0 or newer.

h3(#installation-and-usage). Installation and usage

p. The general behavior stands: paste plugin code to the plugin installer textarea and run the automatic setup. Then just activate the plugin and you are ready to use the new interface under _TXP / Extensions / External output_.

h3(#attributes). Attributes

p. The tag is @<txp:rah_external_output />@ and attributes for it follow. The tag is a secondary feature, and the automatic URL call method should be preferred over the tag.

p. *name*
Name of the external output you want to display.
